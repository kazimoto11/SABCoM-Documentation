Welcome to SABCoM's documentation!
==================================
SABCoM is an open source, easy-to-use-and-adapt, spatial network, multi-agent, model that can be used
to simulate the effects of different lockdown policy measures on the spread of the Covid-19 virus in several South African cities.
The model is designed to simulate and analyse the spread of Covid-19 at the level of individual people.

This distinguishes the model from most epidemiology models which operate top down and at a higher level of abstraction.
This makes our model particularly useful for researchers and policy makers needing to study the impact of Covid-19 in highly
heterogenous and unequal populations, e.g. neighbourhoods with vulnerable populations alongside wealthy populations.
The bottom up granularity further allows for the analysis of targeted measures such as quarantining certain neighbourhoods,
transmission reduction measures (such as wearing masks), and targeted social distancing measures aimed at specific segments
of the population.

The model is described in detail in our paper: SABCoM: A Spatial Agent-Based Covid-19 Model. The code for our model is open-source and available on Github.
